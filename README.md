## Usage
luge is made to be fast and easy to use. Most of the things happen under the hood so you just have to include the files to start using it:

    <link rel="stylesheet" href="/path/to/luge.css">
    <script src="/path/to/luge.js"></script>

luge is also available as a npm package:

```npm install @waaark/luge```

Then:

```import luge from '@waaark/luge'```

Note that the CSS file is only needed if you plan to use the built-in animations (reveals or transitions).

That's it.

The next thing to do is to add luge `data-lg-...` attributes in your html to start using luge features, as explained in the [documentation](https://luge.cool/docs/).
